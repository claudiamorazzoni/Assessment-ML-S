# Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment

***
## Overview

Assessment of Machine Learning and Statistics - Showing the scope of the model's learning outcomes while providing working examples to show potential employers. The overall assessment is split into the two components as detailed below:

+ Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook - Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms.
+ Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook - An example hypothesis test using ANOVA using scipy.stats.

+ [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
+ [keras](https://keras.io/)

#### Also check the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/claudiamorazzoni/Assessment-ML-S/blob/main/requirements.txt) to see the libraries used and their version.

## Jupyter Installation

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    $ pip install notebook

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

    $ jupyter notebook

### Running in a remote installation

You need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).
